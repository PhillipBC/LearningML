# LearningML

I would like to organise any code added to this repository into directories for each project or set of calculations. So code in
any one directory should be independent of code in any other directory.

The LearningMNIST directory has all the code for training a network to recognise hand written digits

The LearningQuadratic directory has code for getting a network to learn the x^2 function and look at the associated loss function.

The Notes folder has tex/pdf files where we can write notes about code we add, how it was used, results it produced etc.

I would also like to save any general purpose scripts not associated with any one project in this directory, 
(for example the draw_a_network.py which draws a picture of a given network).
