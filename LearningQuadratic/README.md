# LearningQuadratic

The neural_network.py file is similar to the one in the LearningMNIST directory at the moment. This will likely change
as more calculations are performed to study simple networks.

The Jupyter notebook FittingNeuralNetworkToQuadratic.ipynb runs through a set of calculations which train a simple
network to learn the x^2 function and then looks at how the associated loss function changes as the different parameters
the network are varied.

The script neural_net_function.py is a script performing the same calculations as in the Juypter notebook. This is intended for
exploring similar calculations training networks to learn functions other than a quadratic if we choose to in the future.
